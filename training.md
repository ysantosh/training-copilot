Github copilot is an "AI coding assistant". It allows developers to write code faster with less effort so that developer can focus on problem solving and collaboration.

This is an AI coding assistant and not a replacement so before using it we should know the strength and limitation of the tool. When to use it and when not to use it.

GitHub Copilot has been proven to increase developer productivity and accelerate the pace of software development.​ During this training you'll learn how to accelerate your development tasks using GitHub Copilot and GitHub Copilot Chat in a Visual Studio Code environment. You'll learn how to use GitHub Copilot and GitHub Copilot Chat to explain complex or unfamiliar code, generate project and inline documentation, develop new code features based on prompts and comments, create unit tests, and improve the code quality, reliability, performance, and security of an existing codebase.​
